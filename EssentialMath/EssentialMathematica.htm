<p align="left"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathematica</i> is a fully integrated
system for technical computing.&nbsp; Among the capabilities it offers are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">an interactive front end with notebook interface</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">numerical calculations with (practically) unlimited
    precision</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">symbolic manipulation</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">special functions</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">graphics</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">typesetting</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">extensibility</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Within a <i>Mathematica</i> notebook you can develop solutions
to complex problems that combine symbolic derivations, numerical calculations,
and graphical displays in an interactive document.&nbsp; The tools provided by <i>Mathematica</i>
will help you focus more on conceptual development and visualization than on
details of algebra or procedural programming.&nbsp; Your solution can be
documented and presented in a very appealing format using the typesetting tools
provided by the front end interface.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials provided here are based upon a
course, <a href="http://www.physics.umd.edu/courses/Phys426">PHYS426</a>,
that I have taught at the University of Maryland several times during the last
few years.&nbsp; The purpose of this course is to provide
mastery of the <i>Mathematica</i> tools and techniques most relevant to
scientists and engineers.&nbsp; No prior familiarity with <i>Mathematica</i> is
needed.&nbsp; The course consists of a collection of tutorials that present concepts and
practical techniques in a systematic fashion.&nbsp; Many people, including many
faculty, attempt to learn <i>Mathematica</i> in a very haphazard fashion,
learning just enough of the basic syntax to evaluate a few integrals, perform
simple numerical calculations, and make some basic graphs, without ever
understanding how the system works.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this approach often
leads to frustration because it provides no basis for interpreting errors or
unexpected output.&nbsp; It also tends to produce rather inefficient and clumsy
code.&nbsp; Effective use of <i>Mathematica</i> requires training the mind to
formulate problems in new ways, not just to apply new syntax to old
methods.&nbsp; If you take the time to work through the tutorials and exercises,
you will understand the system well enough to use it both efficiently and
creatively.&nbsp; You will be amazed at how much you can accomplish with so
little code, especially if you are a veteran programmer in traditional
languages.&nbsp; I now find <i>Mathematica</i> indispensable to my research
productivity and am confident that you soon will also.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials for this course consist of two types of notebooks.&nbsp; <b><i>Language</i></b> notebooks present the
basic concepts and techniques of the <i>Mathematica</i> system using relatively
simple exercises.&nbsp; <b><i>Application</i></b> notebooks present solutions to
more interesting problems at considerably greater depth.&nbsp; These notebooks
are intended to illustrate the use of <i>Mathematica</i> for research in the
form of polished documents which introduce a problem, outline the strategy for
its solution, implement that solution, discuss interesting examples, and draw
conclusions.&nbsp; The language notebooks are designed to present <i>Mathematica</i>
in a nearly linear fashion, building an edifice one block at a time, whereas
application notebooks use whatever tools are needed to solve a particular
problem or class of problems.&nbsp; Therefore, applications may use features of <i>Mathematica</i>
before they are covered in the course, but links to related course materials or
to on-line documentation are provided where appropriate.&nbsp; After all, in
research one does not choose problems according to the tools at hand, but rather
acquires the tools needed for a problem as those needs are recognized!&nbsp; You
are encouraged to jump back and forth between application and language
notebooks.&nbsp; The style of reading from page 1 to the end is <i>passé.</i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> </i>The notebooks may be accessed using
the hyperlinks below.&nbsp; To view the files directly, you must configure your
web browser to launch either <i>Mathematica</i> or <i>MathReader</i> for files
with the <i>nb</i> extension.&nbsp; <i><a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathreader/">MathReader</a></i> 
is a free program that
will display or print a <i>Mathematica </i>notebook, but it cannot evaluate or
edit notebooks.&nbsp;
Alternatively, you may download files to your computer and launch the
application manually.&nbsp; To ensure that the hyperlinks between notebook files
work correctly, you must reproduce my file structure for the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Create a top directory for the course, such as <i>c:\My Notebooks\tutorial course</i>.&nbsp;
    Save the file <i><a href="contents.nb">contents</a> </i>here.</li>
  <li>

</ol>
<p align="left">The entire directory tree can be downloaded from <i>
<a href="EssentialMathematicaArchive.zip">EssentialMathematicaArchive</a></i> or 
individual files can be obtained using the links tabulated below.&nbsp; After 
downloading, the table of <i><a href="contents.nb">contents</a></i>
provides the simplest means of accessing course materials.&nbsp; I recommend
creating a shortcut to this file on your desktop.&nbsp; If you open this file first
and then use its hyperlinks to open other notebooks, the hyperlinks between
notebooks should work properly.&nbsp; Although you can open notebooks directly,
hyperlinks between notebooks may not work properly that way.&nbsp; Nor will
these hyperlinks work if you open files from your browser without downloading
them.&nbsp; Nevertheless, you should be able to view and evaluate these
notebooks if your browser has been configured properly.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the course materials originated in
1997, but undergo frequent revision as both <i>Mathematica</i> and the
course evolve.&nbsp; Dates for the last revision of each notebook are included
in the listings for your convenience.&nbsp; <b>The most recent major revision 
was in January 2006, updating the notebooks for Version 5.2.&nbsp; </b></p>

<h2>Advice for students</h2>
<p>The notebooks which comprise this book are intended to teach <i>Mathematica</i>
by example and by practice. Ideally the course should be studied in a tutorial
format in which an instructor guides students through a progression of exercises
which develop skill and understanding through practice. However, if you are
studying <i>Mathematica</i> independently, please work the exercises  do not
just read the text and skip the exercises. Do not be discouraged if you have had
negative experiences in the past with an instructor in one of your courses who
expected you to learn <i>Mathematica</i> after just one or two lectures. It is
only through practice that one can train the mind to approach problem solving in
new ways and this takes time and patience. <i>Mathematica</i> provides many
tools which will help you to solve and visualize problems in new ways, and these
tools are well worth the effort needed to master them. The notebooks in this
book will guide you toward mastery of the most important tools in <i>Mathematica</i>
slowly, with exercises you can work at your own pace. By the time you complete
the two core notebooks, <b><i>getting started</i></b> and <b><i>functions</i></b>,
you will have acquired a solid foundation that will allow you to easily learn
and apply the particular tools most appropriate to your needs. Take the time
needed to understand the material presented in these notebooks well.</p>
<h2>Advice for instructors</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book arose from a course that I teach at the
University of Maryland. Although I am a professor of physics, the course is
intended for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in any field
of science, engineering, or mathematics. Thus, although many of the examples are
naturally from physics, many examples are also drawn from mathematics (iterated
functions and fractals), biology (population dynamics), and chemistry (chemical
oscillators). The prerequisites are calculus and introductory physics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too often students receive their first introduction to <i>Mathematica</i>
in just one or two class periods of a course which uses <i>Mathematica</i> as
one of the tools employed in the presentation of its primary subject. The
unfortunate student is then expected to master new concepts, syntax, and
programming techniques in a couple of hours. This impossible burden often
alienates the student so completely that he or she abandons <i>Mathematica</i>
once that course is finished. If any of your students have suffered through that
experience, please reassure them that the tools provided by <i>Mathematica</i>
are worth a considerable investment of effort and that your course will offer
sufficient time and practice to acquire mastery of them. Mastery of <i>Mathematica</i>
is like mastery of a second language  it requires time, patience, practice,
immersion, repetition, and more patience. Any second language becomes much
easier when a person begins to think in that language without having to
translate every thought. Languages cannot be learned by passively listening to
lectures, but require active immersion and practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My course was taught in a teaching theater using a
tutorial format. The teaching theater provides each student with a computer and
the instructor with equipment to project the instructor's monitor, transmit the
instructor's screen to each student monitor, and to view and/or project any
monitor in the room. Networking software permits communication or collaboration
between students and the instructor. Assignments were distributed and collected
electronically. All materials for the course were presented in the form of <i>Mathematica</i>
notebooks.&nbsp; Most classes began with a brief introduction to the lesson of
the day, with the instructor's monitor transmitted to the students. I would work
through and discuss the appropriate section of a notebook, and then the students
would work some of the exercises in that notebook as I circulated through the
room offering help and suggestions where needed. If several students were
experiencing similar problems, I might give hints to the entire class or might
return to my computer and show how a particular problem might be solved.
Occasionally, I would project the solution produced by a student and comment on
it or allow the student to present it. After students have completed the
exercises for one topic, a new topic would be introduced by the instructor and
then the students would perform the exercises for that section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found that it was very important to allow students to
work through the materials for themselves as much as possible. Students are very
anxious to place their hands on the keyboard and to dive right in; students tend
to have relatively little patience for dry lectures. Most students learn
relatively little from listening, but learn a lot from working the embedded
exercises and discussing strategies for the solution of specific problems. The
tutorial format requires more time than lecturing, but is much more effective.
Do not try to go too fast! It is more important for students to begin to think
in <i>Mathematica</i> style than to hear or read the syntax for thousands of
functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essential core of an introductory course in <i>Mathematica</i>
is contained within the two notebooks <b><i>getting started</i></b> and<b><i>
functions</i></b>, each of which requires approximately three weeks to cover.
The student who has mastered these lessons is already quite proficient in the
use of <i>Mathematica</i> and should be able to identify and learn the
additional tools needed for his/her purposes with relatively little help from
the instructor. Therefore, the selection of topics for the remainder of a
standard one semester course permits flexibility to meet the needs of the class.
A sample curriculum is given below with estimated times.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The notebook on <b><i>dimensional analysis</i></b>, or
parts of it, should be assigned as homework soon after completion of <b><i>getting
started</i></b>. Within <b><i>functions</i></b> is a problem on Julia sets that
is easy and fun; I assigned it between two classes and then presented <b><i>julia.nb</i></b>
as an example of modular programming after the students turned in their
solutions. Depending upon the pace of the class, <b><i>plotting</i></b> can
either be covered in class or parts of it assigned as homework; I used the
diffraction problem as a homework assignment that reinforced techniques of
modular programming as well as covering plotting features. I chose to omit <b><i>lists</i></b>
to permit more time for <b><i>differential equations</i></b>. I also used <b><i>frequency
analysis</i></b> to shed additional insight upon limit cycles (van der Pol
oscillator) and the logistic map. A miniproject based upon <b><i>Koch</i></b>
was also a lot of fun.</p>

<h2>Style sheet</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; you would like to prepare notebooks with the
style used for these course materials, you will need the style sheet <i><a href="TutorialJJK.nb">TutorialJJK.nb</a></i>.</p>
<h2>Solutions to exercises</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Detailed solutions to all of the exercises in <i><b>getting
started</b></i> and <b><i>functions</i></b> and to many of the exercises in
other notebooks are available to qualified instructors upon request.&nbsp; These
solutions have not been made public so that instructors can assign homework
without the solutions being in general circulation.</p>
